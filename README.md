# ICP NNS Plugin for ElizaOS

**@crosschainlabs/plugin-icp-nns** is an ElizaOS provider that fetches **Network Nervous System (NNS)** proposals from the Internet Computer (ICP) Governance canister. It supports **topic** and **status** filters and returns a normalized list of proposals ready for downstream AI agents.

> Designed to plug into the [**AI-Driven Governance & Security for ICP**](https://github.com/CrossChainLabs-ICP/ai-neuron) workflow, but usable in any Eliza-based project.

- ðŸ”Ž **Filter by topic / status** via a simple command syntax.
- ðŸ§­ **Normalize output** into a concise `Proposal[]` structure for agents.
